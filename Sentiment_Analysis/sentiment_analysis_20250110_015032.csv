2025-01-10 00:12:40,"Python in DevOps: My Favorite Tools Hey! 👋

I rely on Python to do a lot of Ops / DevOps-type automation:  automate workflows, create dashboards, manage infrastructure, and build helpful tools. Over time, I’ve found some Python-based approaches that make these tasks much easier and more efficient. Here’s what I use:

[https://www.pulumi.com/blog/python-for-devops/](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/python-for-devops/)

* Custom dashboards with Flask and Prometheus Client
* Automating workflows Schedule, then RQ, then finally Airflow
* Network analysis with Scapy
* Click / Typer / Rich for CLI (Starting with Click, but always moving past it at some point)

And, of course, a bunch more.

Then, for fun, I tried to use Python for everything in a single service  - using dagger for the container and pulumi for the Infra. ( I work for pulumi bc I'm a big fan of being able to use Python this way :) )

2025-01-09 17:33:17,"Cyantic - build complex objects from simple blueprints using pydantic # What the project does

Cyantic lets you build complex types from simple blueprints in your pydantic models, with type-safety and validation built in.

**https://github.com/flywhl/cyantic**

* Type-safe blueprints with validation, since they are pydantic models.
* Reference other values using `@value:x.y.z`
* Import objects using `@import:x.y.z`
* Load data from environment variables using `@env:VAR`
* Define custom `@hook` handlers (see tests)

For my work, I have to instantiate a lot of `torch.Tensors`, and I wanted a way to do this from YAML specs (how I specify models). So I built a kind of middleware, which uses intermediary Pydantic models as blueprints, and instantiates them into full objects during pydantic's build process. Now I can pass in parameters (mean and standard deviation), and get a fully-built `Tensor` in a pydantic model.

This is now a library, Cyantic - named after cyanotype photography (i.e. the ""blueprint"").

# Target Audience

It's clearly useful for science/data-science work, esp as scientists start moving away from `dict`s to use pydantic.

2025-01-09 16:24:29,"obliquetree: Advanced Decision Tree Implementation # obliquetree

`obliquetree` is an advanced decision tree library designed to offer high-performance and interpretable models. It supports both classification and regression tasks, enabling a wide range of applications. By leveraging both traditional and oblique splits, `obliquetree` provides flexibility and improved generalization, particularly in shallow trees, making it a powerful alternative to conventional decision trees.

You can access the project from here: [ObliqueTree GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sametcopur/obliquetree)

What `obliquetree` Does:

* **Oblique Splits for Better Patterns**: Utilizes linear combinations of features for splitting, capturing complex patterns effectively.
* **Traditional Splits for Simplicity**: Supports axis-aligned splits, maintaining simplicity and interpretability.
* **Performance Optimization**: Ensures high speed and efficiency while supporting categorical features and missing value handling.
* **Scalability and Interpretability**: Excels at providing interpretable models with fewer splits.

# Key Features

* **Oblique Splits**: Use linear combinations of features to capture complex data patterns.
* **Axis-Aligned Splits**: Supports conventional decision tree behavior for simplicity.
* **Categorical Feature Handling**: Works seamlessly with categorical data, requiring only label encoding.
* **Optimized Performance**: Up to 50% faster for float columns and 200% faster for integer columns compared to `scikit-learn`.
* **Feature Constraints**: Limit the number of features used in oblique splits for simpler, interpretable trees.
* **Missing Value Handling**: Automatically assigns missing values (`NaN`) to optimal leaves.
* **Seamless Integration**: Guarantees results equivalent to `scikit-learn` when oblique features are disabled.

# Target Audience

* **Data Scientists and Engineers**: Looking for interpretable decision trees with advanced splitting options.
* **Researchers**: Exploring oblique decision trees and their advantages over traditional methods.
* **ML Practitioners**: Seeking models that balance interpretability with performance for datasets with linear or complex relationships.

# Comparison to Existing Alternatives

* **Versus Standard Decision Trees**: `obliquetree` supports oblique splits for capturing more complex relationships, providing better generalization with shallow trees.
* **Versus** `scikit-learn`: Provides faster performance and native support for categorical features and missing values.

# Algorithm & Performance

The `obliquetree` algorithm supports both oblique and axis-aligned splits, dynamically selecting the best type for each decision point. By optimizing for shallower trees, it ensures better generalization with fewer splits, especially on datasets with linear relationships. Performance tests demonstrate significant speed improvements compared to `scikit-learn`.

# Quick Start: Install obliquetree via pip

    pip install obliquetree

# Example Usage

    from obliquetree import Classifier
    
    # Initialize the model
    model = Classifier(
        use_oblique=True,       # Enable oblique splits
        max_depth=3,            # Maximum tree depth
        n_pair=2,               # Number of feature pairs for optimization
        random_state=42,        # Reproducibility
        categories=[0, 10, 32], # Specify categorical features
    )
    
    # Fit the model on the training dataset
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Predict on the test dataset
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

2025-01-09 06:17:33,"PEP 769 – Add a ‘default’ keyword argument to ‘attrgetter’ and ‘itemgetter’ PEP 769 – Add a ‘default’ keyword argument to ‘attrgetter’ and ‘itemgetter’ [https://peps.python.org/pep-0769/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0769/)

# Abstract

This proposal aims to enhance the operator module by adding a default keyword argument to the attrgetter and itemgetter functions. This addition would allow these functions to return a specified default value when the targeted attribute or item is missing, thereby preventing exceptions and simplifying code that handles optional attributes or items.

# Motivation

Currently, attrgetter and itemgetter raise exceptions if the specified attribute or item is absent. This limitation requires developers to implement additional error handling, leading to more complex and less readable code.

Introducing a default parameter would streamline operations involving optional attributes or items, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing code clarity.

# Examples

    >>> obj = [""foo"", ""bar"", ""baz""]
    >>> itemgetter(1, default=""XYZ"")(obj)
    'bar'
    >>> itemgetter(5, default=""XYZ"")(obj)
    'XYZ'
    >>> itemgetter(1, 0, default=""XYZ"")(obj)
    ('bar', 'foo')
    >>> itemgetter(1, 5, default=""XYZ"")(obj)

Arch is an intelligent [Layer 7](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-layer-7/) gateway (proxy) designed to protect, observe, and personalize AI agents with your APIs. The project was born out of the belief that: Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems for personalization - all outside business logic.

Check out the project here: [https://github.com/katanemo/archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) Ask me anything.

# Target Audience

Meant to help developers building AI Agents in production with safety, observablity and personalization features needed for differentiation. Focus on the stuff that matters, not the crufty work to get agents into production.

# Comparison

Compared to NGINX, HAProxy, Envoy - Arch Gateway was designed for prompts.

2025-01-09 04:07:27," Introducing pdf2csv – A PDF to csv/xlsx convertor CLI and python library I’m excited to share **pdf2csv**, a lightweight tool to extract tables from PDFs and convert them into CSV or XLSX formats. It’s especially helpful for right-to-left (RTL) languages like Farsi, Hebrew, and Arabic, ensuring clean, properly formatted text. 🎉

# What My Project Does:

**pdf2csv** extracts structured table data from PDF files using the **Docling** library. It converts these tables into Pandas DataFrames and saves them as CSV or XLSX files. It includes optional RTL text reversal for languages where text direction might be an issue.

You can use **pdf2csv** directly in Python, via CLI, or with **uv** for a streamlined workflow.

# Target Audience:

This tool is for anyone working with PDF table data, especially developers, data analysts, or researchers who need clean, structured outputs from PDFs. It works well for production environments but is simple enough for personal and academic use.

# Comparison:

Existing PDF-to-table tools often struggle with right-to-left (RTL) languages or require extra configuration. **pdf2csv** is:

* **RTL-Aware**: Specifically designed to handle languages like Farsi, Hebrew, and Arabic.
* **Flexible**: Supports both CSV and XLSX outputs with additional customization options.
* **Lightweight**: Uses efficient libraries like Pandas and Docling for fast, reliable extraction.

**Github repo:**

[https://github.com/ghodsizadeh/pdf2csv](https://github.com/ghodsizadeh/pdf2csv)

# Examples

# CLI:

    pdf2csv convert-cli example.pdf --output-dir ./output --output-format xlsx --rtl --verbose

# Python:

    from pdf2csv.converter import convert
    
    dfs = convert(""example.pdf"", output_dir=""./output"", rtl=True, output_format=""xlsx"")
    for df in dfs:
        print(df.head())

2025-01-08 16:48:11,"Flowkeeper -- a PySide6 (Python + Qt6) application Greetings! Meet [Flowkeeper](https://flowkeeper.org/), a cross-platform desktop Pomodoro timer, which took me about a year to reach its current state. It is implemented in Python and relies on Qt6 for its UI. It supports recent macOS, Windows 10 and 11, and any mainstream Linux released within a couple of years, e.g. Ubuntu 22.04. 

Feel free to reuse parts of it, or ask me any questions about how things are implemented.

# What My Project Does

It allows you plan your work for the day, and then execute it using Pomodoro Technique.

# Target Audience

Power users -- mainly creative professionals and students. Flowkeeper can be used in production and enterprise environments.

# Comparison

Compared to a typical Pomodoro timer, Flowkeeper: 

* Implements Pomodoro Technique exactly as described in the [original book](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/Pomodoro%252520Guide_0.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjNsqig_eWKAxW7U6QEHZQMA-8QFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw20GKwRpyxshlCpBzcw7-40),
* Supports a wider range of desktop operating systems, including diverse Linux environments,
* Is more lightweight and performant (it's not based on Electron, and I routinely test it on a Core 2 Duo machine),
* Has portable versions and does not require admin rights to install,
* Is optimized for power users (keyboard shortcuts and rich set of settings),
* Does NOT have a paid version,
* Does NOT have a mobile version,
* Does NOT synchronize data across devices,
* Is NOT translated to multiple languages.

# Details

Flowkeeper codebase on GitHub has examples of Python + Qt6

* Resources,
* Theming,
* QSS,
* WebSockets,
* OAuth,
* Audio,
* Actions with configurable shortcuts,
* TableViews with custom delegates,
* Custom visualization / painting,
* Search with auto-completion,
* Wizards,
* Charts,
* Window state trickery -- saving size on exit, minimize to tray, move via dragging window content, ...,
* Checking GitHub Releases for updates,
* Home-made tutorial with call-outs,
* Home-made generic Settings dialog,
* Home-made end-to-end (UI) tests,
* Configurable integration with external tools,
* Tray icons generated on the fly,
* Drag-and-drop with placeholders,
* Ensuring a single application instance is running at a time,
* The GitHub pipeline, which builds a Windows installer, a DEB, a macOS DMG, and some portable binaries.

Of course, I would appreciate if you have any feedback about the code or the app itself. If you find a bug or would like to request a new feature, please create a GitHub Issue. Thanks!

2025-01-07 05:42:55,"Tiny Python library that turns functions into GUI apps
 Hey! I made a small tool that lets you create GUI applications just by writing normal Python functions. It's inspired by FastAPI-Typer, but for desktop-mobile GUIs.

## Quick Start
Normal function (no interface limitations)
```python
from functogui import App

def is_even(number: int = 4) -> bool:
    return number % 2 == 0

App(is_even)
```

Function with UI types (With data limitations)
```python
from functogui import App, intUi, intReturn
from typing import Annotated

def time_to_seconds(hours: Annotated[int, intUi(max_value=24)] = 1,
                    minutes: Annotated[int, intUi(max_value=59)] = 30
                    ) -> int:
    
    return (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60)

App(time_to_seconds)
```

That's it - it creates a complete GUI with a slider and shows the result in real-time. Useful for quick tools and prototypes when you don't want to mess with UI code.

Built with Kivy, supports file handling, image preview, and different input types. Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions!

2025-01-06 20:38:54,"I built my own PyTorch from scratch over the last 5 months in C and modern Python. **What My Project Does**

Magnetron is a machine learning framework I built from scratch over the past 5 months in C and modern Python. It’s inspired by frameworks like PyTorch but designed for deeper understanding and experimentation. It supports core ML features like automatic differentiation, tensor operations, and computation graph building while being lightweight and modular (under 5k LOC).



**Target Audience**

Magnetron is intended for developers and researchers who want a transparent, low-level alternative to existing ML frameworks. It’s great for learning how ML frameworks work internally, experimenting with novel algorithms, or building custom features (feel free to hack).

**Comparison**

Magnetron differs from PyTorch and TensorFlow in several ways:

• It’s entirely designed and implemented by me, with minimal external dependencies.

• It offers a more modular and compact API tailored for both ease of use and low-level access.

• The focus is on understanding and innovation rather than polished production features.

Magnetron already supports CPU computation, automatic differentiation, and custom memory allocators. I’m currently implementing the CUDA backend, with plans to make it pip-installable soon.

      3     return 10
      4
      5 def bar():
      6     return 20
      7
      8 foo()

pyftrace output:

    $ pyftrace foobar.py
    Running script: examples/foobar.py
        Called foo from line 9
            Called bar from line 2
            Returning bar-> 20

**Target Audience** 

Students, developers, researchers, and others who need to analyze function call relationships in large Python code bases.



**Comparison**



There are other fantastic function tracing tools besides pyftrace (including Traceback inside Python).

But pyftrace has its own advantages like below:

# 

If it can be further developed, I expect it to be of great help in analyzing and debugging complex Python project files.

pyftrace was first introduced at Pycon Korea 2024 and is currently maintained by a single maintainer developer.

Your feedback is essential for the project's development.

If you have any feedback, please leave an issue, or at least support pyftrace with a star, it will be greatly appreciated.

2025-01-07 09:08:29,"Creating a Tiny Text to Video Model From Scratch # What My Project Does

This project is an early, small-scale attempt to create a text to video model that generates videos from text prompts, showcasing the basics of how these models are developed.

# Target audience

This project is designed for individuals who want to learn how to create their own text-to-video model from scratch but don't know where to start. It will provide a basic guide from beginning to end, covering everything from generating the training data to training a model and using that trained model to generate AI videos.

# Comparison

For those who aren’t deep into research papers and just want a simple notebook guide for a fun project—or for rookie developers looking to understand the practical implementation beyond just the theory, I’ve created a small-scale GAN architecture. It’s similar to text-to-video models and can be trained on a CPU or a single T4 GPU.

2025-01-06 22:03:07,"uv-migrator: A New Tool to Easily Migrate Your Python Projects to UV Package Manager I wanted to share a tool I've created called uv-migrator that helps you migrate your existing Python projects to use the new UV package manager. I have liked alot of the features of UV personally but found moving all my projects over to it to be somewhat clunky and fustrating.

This is my first rust project so the code base is a bit messy but now that i have a good workflow and supporting tests i feel like its in a good place to release and get additional feedback or feature requests.

## What My Project Does

* Automatically converts projects from Poetry, Pipenv, or requirements.txt to UV
* Preserves all your dependencies, including dev dependencies and dependency groups
* Migrates project metadata (version, description, authors, tools sections, etc.)
* Preserves comments (this one drove me mildly insane)

## Target Audience

Developers with large amounts of existing projects who want to switch to uv from their current package manager system easily 

## Comparison

This saves alot of time vs manually configuring and inputting the dependencies or creating lots of adhoc bash scripts. UV itself does not have great support for migrating projects seamlessly.

Id like to avoid talking about if someone should/shouldn't use the uv project specifically if possible and I also have no connection to astral/uv itself.

2025-01-07 03:40:47,"Kompressor, a cli to compress, convert, resize, trim, and slugify images. At work I get sent a lot of images to post on our site. Kung-fooing them into shape can be a pain so I wrote this app to handle all the problems I run into. Check it out here, https://github.com/8cylinder/kompressor


**What My Project Does**

It's a wrapper around other cli tools, pngquant, jpegoptim, webp, exiftool.  Plus it uses Pillow and Python-slugify to do further image modification.

This is built to solve my specific problems, but, I think it might be useful for others.

One thing that is a common annoyance is that I often get images with a single row off color pixels down one side of the images (I think its from a bad export from Figma).  Normally I would have to fire up an images editor and try to crop that edge of the image, but with this tool I can just just tell it to remove 1px from the left side.  Easy peasy.

Another thing that's nice, is that I can choose to rename the original and or the new image.  This makes it easy to try different compression levels and have them side by side and toggle back and forth with preview to see any differences.

**Target Audience**

This is for people like me that have to prepare multiple images for the web. And in most cases removes the need to use an image editor.

**Comparison**

I'm sure there are a hundred other tools like this out there that people have built to solve their own particular issues, but I couldn't find one that worked for me.

2025-01-06 10:27:33,"New features in Python 3.13 Obviously this is a quite subjective list of what jumped out to me, you can check out the full list in [official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-locals-semantics).

```
import copy
from argparse import ArgumentParser
from dataclasses import dataclass
```

- **`__static_attributes__` lists attributes from all methods, new `__name__` in `@property`**:

```
@dataclass
class Test:
    def foo(self):
        self.x = 0

    def bar(self):
        self.message = 'hello world'

    @property
    def is_ok(self):
        return self.q

# Get list of attributes set in any method
print(Test.__static_attributes__)  # Outputs: 'x', 'message'

# new `__name__` attribute in `@property` fields, can be useful in external functions
def print_property_name(prop):
    print(prop.__name__)

print_property_name(Test.is_ok)  # Outputs: is_ok
```

- `copy.replace()` can be used instead of `dataclasses.replace()`, custom classes can implement `__replace__()` so it works with them too:

```
@dataclass
class Point:
    x: int
    y: int
    z: int

# copy with fields replaced
print(copy.replace(Point(x=0,y=1,z=10), y=-1, z=0))
```

- **argparse now supports deprecating CLI options**:

```
parser = ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--baz', deprecated=True, help=""Deprecated option example"")
args = parser.parse_args()
```

**configparser now supports unnamed sections for top-level key-value pairs**:

```
from configparser import ConfigParser
config = ConfigParser(allow_unnamed_section=True)
config.read_string(""""""
key1 = value1
key2 = value2
"""""")
print(config[""DEFAULT""][""key1""])  # Outputs: value1
```

### HONORARY (Brief mentions)
- Improved REPL (multiline editing, colorized tracebacks) in native python REPL, previously had to use `ipython` etc. for this
- doctest output is now colorized by default
- Default type hints supported (although IMO syntax for it is ugly)
- (Experimental) Disable GIL for true multithreading (but it slows down single-threaded performance)
- Official support for Android and iOS
- Common leading whitespace in docstrings is stripped automatically

### EXPERIMENTAL / PLATFORM-SPECIFIC
- New Linux-only API for time notification file descriptors in `os`.
- PyTime API for system clock access in the C API.

2025-01-06 09:42:29,"Tuitorial - I built a terminal-based tool for code presentations because PowerPoint was too painful
 # What My Project Does

[Tuitorial](https://github.com/basnijholt/tuitorial) lets you create interactive code tutorials that run in your terminal. The key insight is that you define your code ONCE, then create multiple views highlighting different parts using pattern matching rules - no more copy-pasting code snippets across slides! Features include:

* Write code once, create multiple highlighted views
* Interactive step-by-step navigation
* Rich syntax highlighting
* Support for Markdown and even images
* Configure via Python or YAML
* Live reload for quick iterations

Here's a quick demo: [https://www.nijho.lt/post/tuitorial/tuitorial-0.4.0.mp4](https://www.nijho.lt/post/tuitorial/tuitorial-0.4.0.mp4) which runs [this YAML format presentation `pipefunc.yaml`](https://github.com/basnijholt/tuitorial/blob/main/examples/pipefunc.yaml)

# Target Audience

This is for the 0.1% of people who:

* Are giving technical presentations or workshops
* Love terminal-based tools
* Are tired of copying the same code into multiple PowerPoint slides
* Want version-controlled, reproducible tutorials

It's particularly useful for teaching scenarios where you want to focus attention on specific parts of code while keeping everything in context.

# Comparison to Existing Alternatives

The problem with traditional tools:

* PowerPoint/Google Slides: Forces you to copy-paste code multiple times just to highlight different parts
* Jupyter notebooks: Great for readers, but during presentations there's too much text for the audience to get distracted by
* Spiel: While also terminal-based, it's more for general presentations without code-specific features
* REPLs: Interactive but lack structured presentation
* Many others linked in [this issue](https://github.com/basnijholt/tuitorial/issues/25), all general purpose terminal presentation tools

Tuitorial solves these issues by letting you define code once and create multiple views through highlighting rules, all while staying in the familiar terminal environment.

The project started as a solution to my own frustration while trying to present another package I built ([pipefunc](https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc)). Sometimes the best tools come from scratching your own itch!

# What is Potato?

**Potato** is a Python package designed to halt your code's execution with precision and simplicity. It’s perfect for debugging, testing control flow, or adding a bit of fun to your scripts. The best part? You don’t even have to install it. Python natively supports Potato, thanks to its strict variable naming rules.

Just type potato into your source code and watch the magic happen! Your script will immediately halt with a NameError, leaving your colleagues (or future self) wondering why there's a potato in your code.

# Why Potato?

* **Zero Dependencies**: Potato requires absolutely no installations or updates.
* **Lightweight**: Takes up 0 bytes of storage.
* **Instant Debugging**: Clearly marks the exact point in your code where Potato strikes.
* **Fun for Everyone**: Confuse your friends, co-workers, and even your future self with a well-placed `potato`!

# Installation

There is no installation. Python comes with Potato pre-installed. Simply open your favorite Python script and start typing `potato`.

# Usage

# Example 1: Halting a Script

    print(""Hello, world!"")
    potato
    print(""This will never run."")

**Output:**

    Hello, world!
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""example.py"", line 2, in <module>
        potato
    NameError: name 'potato' is not defined

# Example 2: Asserting Dominance in the Codebase

    if user_input == ""42"":
        print(""You cracked the ultimate answer!"")
    else:
        potato

**Output:**

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""example.py"", line 4, in <module>
        potato
    NameError: name 'potato' is not defined

# Example 3: Leaving Easter Eggs

    # TODO: Replace potato with actual logic later
    potato
