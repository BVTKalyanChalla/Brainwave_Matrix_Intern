They would give me money for the tuition and i would spend it on drugs, and i continued to do that until last month when i realized that i had no sense of direction, no hobbies except gaming all day and sleeping, i was just straight up fucking up everything in my life and so i quit drugs, I started praying and fasting ( basically in the orthodox christian religion you have these set periods of time before Christmas or Easter where you can’t eat animal products like eggs milk and meat).
While doing this fast i rediscovered one of my hobbies that used to bring me a lot of joy and that was cooking and cooking for others, even though i had to use limited ingredients i could still make something tasty. Something reignited in me and i remembered that i once had a dream, to open my own restaurant someday. I completely stopped ordering food online and almost completely dedicated my time to cooking and learning new techniques. Right now im getting ready for my first day working in a real kitchen.

2025-01-09 04:35:51,"Is it really necessary to be so afraid? I am 70 years old. I have lived through some of them more challenging times this country has faced. When my generation was young, we raised a lot of hell and the crime rate in the country was higher than it has ever been since. And yet, today, I see more people being more afraid everyday. And, quite frankly, there is nothing to be afraid of. Unless you live in some of the deepest, darkest, most underprivileged city centers in the country, you are not likely to be accosted or stolen from or even shot. Why do people feel so afraid? 

I have an opinion. I think we pay too much attention to the news. I think there are people who live in hazardous bubbles where their greatest fears are constantly reinforced.  As tragic and frequent as mass shootings are, though, they remain isolated incidents and not a factor in any Americans everyday life. Yet people fear like we live in a war zone. The people in Gaza live in a war zone. They have reason to be afraid. People in Africa fear starvation everyday.  And, even over 20 years since the fall of the Soviet Union, people in Russia are afraid to be heard saying the wrong thing about their government. Those people have reason to be afraid.

Only in China, where outside of socializing, people seem to care about time a lot. In China, if a girl likes you, you're going on the date the same night after you started talking that morning. Companies are willing to hire candidates within 2 or 3 days. You can send something to production right away.

2025-01-09 07:49:40,"I am legally obliged to waste 2 years of my life, when is the best time to do it? I'm 17M and looking to major in maths and maybe go into finance. There's a decent chance I'll go to university in the UK or the US and not my home country. 

The issue is, I'm from a country that requires mandatory military service (about 18-21 months), but its flexible I can choose to go anytime before I'm 26. 

Option 1: Go right after I graduate high school. This gives me a 2nd chance at uni admissions and I can apply to some reaches. But it also means I'm 2 years older than everyone in uni, and from what I hear, this might hinder me socially. 

Option 2: Go after undergrad. With this, I can actually enjoy uni (some of my friends are applying for the same unis as me too), but the issue is that I'll have a massive gap in my resume that says ""I stood at a nuclear-armed border with a rifle for 1.5yrs, this doesn't have anything to do with maths, but pls hire me, oh and also I got paid less than minimum wage while doing it""

Option 3: After masters?? idk but i feel like this is gonna look worse to employers

How much will it hinder my ability to do social things in uni if I'm 2 years older than everyone (option 1)?

How bad will the 2 yr gap in my resume look (option 2)?

ANY advice is welcome!

2025-01-08 14:59:32,"Biggest life lessons Life plays tricks on us and is always changing. At some point, we were probably younger and didn't listen to our elders, and one day, we learned that they were right. Up to your current age, write in the comments what is the greatest lesson that life has taught you.

I will collect the comments and will update as new lessons come out. 
Note: This is not a personal based post, I will not censor any comment, only if the idea is imperceptible, because everyone has their own point of view and although we agree or disagree, we are all the same, all different.

Update:
1. Don't create expectations in anyone.
2. Happiness isn’t a destination; it’s a daily choice.
3. Don't do things for someone who wouldn't do it for you.
4. Focus on what you can control and let go of the rest.
5. Obey the Lord, for He is master of all.
6. Show kindness and compassion to everyone.
7. Your happiness and contentment are in your hands.
8. Your worth isn’t defined by others’ opinions.
9. Don’t judge others; you don’t know their struggles.
10. Embrace your journey and grow through life's twists.
11. Happines exist only when shared.
12. Adaptation is key to face life's challenges.
13. Value your partner; they’re a vital source of support.
14. Change your perspective, not the world.
15. Learn life's lessons and let the past go.
16. Embrace your path and grow through the chaos.
17. Don't assume you have time; act now.
18. Not everything is as it seems.
19. Your worth isn’t tied to external things.
20. It’s better to start late than never.
21. Authenticity is key to fulfillment.
22. This too shall pass. 
23. Prioritize sleeping; sleep deprivation accelerates aging.

25. Embrace that you don’t know everything.
26. Use your time wisely.

The loaner does not demand repayment immediately or in total. We are allowed to enjoy the rewards this debt has given us. But we must pay the debt back later, coin by coin, until the total of what we owe is repaid. There is no peace from it. It is constant. If you can hide from it, or build walls to defend yourself, or never hear about it, then your are the unlucky ones. Others must become its neighbour.

It is not hopeless. This loaner does not have more power than smiles, or kisses, or touch. These small things show it cannot interfere. And that although it will have the final say it must wait, and wait, and wait, and cannot give way to impatience. It knows this. It must wait for us to finish dancing. It must wait for us to finish telling each other stories, or reminding each other of hopes and dreams. It must wait whilst we sit with kids.

2025-01-09 03:52:05,"Loving them more than you love yourself I’ve been in a relationship with this guy off and on for the last 4 years now we got back together a few months ago but he’s not changing for the better at all. Actually he hasn’t changed one bit. The reason we broke up in the past is simply because he fell out love with me when I was being a good girlfriend to him then a few months ago he came back around and asked could we try again for the 4th time and of course I said yes. Well I still haven’t noticed a difference in him he still doesn’t spend time with me he’s always “so busy”, he still doesn’t want to be intimate with me, he still begs me for money every chance he gets when he has a job, all he does in complains about life, all he wants to do is be on facetime all of the time, we haven’t been on a date in about a year in total. 

Neither one of us are happy being in a relationship but every time I work up the courage to leave him then he comes around pretending to be a “good” person and treating me how he should be treating me from the start, I get pulled right back into his miserable arms and boom the cycle repeats itself. 

Looking back he always had a facade he puts on around others especially my parents their convinced he’s a such a good guy he’s the one for me, each time I try explaining to them that I honestly see the real true side of him which they don’t see they always brush me off and says “You won’t find another guy as good as him”. Now that I think about it I was never in a relationship solely because I wanted to be in a relationship I was only in a relationship with him to make my parents happy ( I’m 24 btw ). When I met him I was at a low point of my life ( He’s 24 ) and looking back he took complete advantage of me being in a dark vulnerable state of mind.

Fast forward once he discarded me for the final time I opened my options back up right now I am currently getting to know another guy who does all of the things that my “boyfriend” should be doing.

Ever since I was a child, I was told I would end up alone, not for any particular reason, but just because some people had a “feeling”. As I’ve grown up, and continue to grow, the idea of solitude becomes more and more tempting. I’ve learned to love the discomfort of loneliness. I have never really been good at relationships, I don’t think I have the right type of brain to receive and give love properly. But again, I’m not upset about that, it’s just a realization that I’ve come to. That I feel as though I am meant to spend my life by myself, without any romantic partner, and very few friends. I think solitude is all I need in my life :)

The chances of you specifically being born is 1 in trillions. Human existence defies most laws we are creatures that shouldn’t exist according to nature. Yet we do. The average person will spend their entire life, dreading waking up in the morning. People wake up in an apartment they don’t like, they go to a job they hate, just to die later unfulfilled in what could’ve and should’ve been so much more. It seems most people just spawn with the mindset that life is a repetitive predictable cycle. Get a job, get married, go to work, come back home and enjoy your freedom for 2 days a week. It’s disturbing. Most people live lives they hate. Freedom is the key to life, and it’s the only thing society has stripped away. We look at people like Ted K, Chris Maccandles, and David Thoreau as nut jobs when in reality they knew that life isn’t what it should be nowadays. Same thing with most van lifers, travelers, nomads. They seek new experiences with freedom. Cause life itself is a chance to experience. Nobody else seems to be bothered that mental health is in an insane decline because of SOCIETAL STANDARDS. It’s killing us and keeping some people happy. It’s sad that we even have to look for happiness. It should be there. If you haven’t thought about the concept of life itself, then do. Because it is so much more than we think it is.
