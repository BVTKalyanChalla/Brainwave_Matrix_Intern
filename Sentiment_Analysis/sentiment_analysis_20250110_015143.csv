2025-01-09 18:51:51,"Just rewatched Galaxy Quest: Such a phenomenal movie; fun and hilarious with so many great one liners! Go watch it if you haven’t! This movie is something special. The cast meshes extremely well. Sigourney Weaver was smoking hot in the movie and delivers some phenomenal jokes. Tim Allen is at his peak. Alan Rickman is clearly an actor above the rest and without him, this movie just isn’t the same. He plays his role to perfection. Then you have Sam Rockwell. Easily one of my favorite movies for him. Finally, he’s a bit of a sleeper in this movie, but Tony Shalhoub was quietly hilarious too.  

What I love about this movie is that it’s not just a comedic spoof of Star Trek. I really enjoyed the story which had a surprising number of endearing moments. 

Some of my favorites lines in this movie:

*lands on ship* …….Aaaahhhhhhhhhh

Wait! Don’t open that! It’s an alien planet!!! Is there air?! You don’t know!!!….sniff sniff…seems like there is air

We have to get out of here before they kill guy!!

Guy, you have a last name. Do I?!?! Do I?!?!?!

Besides…..hehehehehe, I just had this really interesting idea. Guy: Are you stoned?

2025-01-09 23:53:55,"Anyone had a delayed emotional response to a movie? (My Old Ass) \*Minor spoilers ahead\*

Earlier this week, I was watching the movie ""My Old Ass."" If you are unfamiliar, the movie has themes of living in the moment. This is something I could admittedly do better at. Specifically, there are two monologues in the film that emphasize ""you never know this is the last time you'll do X."" 

I enjoyed the movie, its themes, and peformances. I was getting ready for bed and thinking about the film in my mind. Maybe 15 minutes after the movie had ended, our baby monitor goes off. I walked into the nursery to replace the pacifier and soothe my kid back to sleep. Then, I connect the dots that this could be the last time I have this kind of moment. I started to weep and really reflect on enjoying these experiences of parenthood. I'm genuinely grateful that the movie made me consider this more closely. 

Has anyone else watched and not had an outward response to it intially, but later become emotional when reflecting on that film? If so, what movie had this effect on you?

2025-01-08 07:14:19,"I still can't get over how good Bullet Train was despite the bizarrely low Rottentomatoes score. At only 53%, I was expecting something along the lines of a generic action movie, those dime a dozen you see, or at best maybe a michael bay caliber production.

Instead I got a highly entertaining movie that's utterly fantastic from david leitch, who's brought us similar fun movies in dp 2 and the fall guy. 

Bullet train has great performances, fun setpieces, lots of action without overly relying on cgi, and the performances are fun too, being just likable enough without overdoing it.

2025-01-08 14:45:30,"Rewatching Josey Wales is making me realize how intense the pro confederacy and anti Union rhetoric is in the movie Didn’t realize how blunt and aggressive it is in how it portrays the union as bad and the confederates as good. It’s not grey about it at all lol it’s very black and white.

The union soldiers are shown to be callous, cold, immoral, dishonest, and conniving. 

The confederate soldiers are shown to be noble, moral, straight-shooting, and possessing of humanity and passion.

I understand that the movie is not portraying the entirety of the two sides, but rather the Jayhawkers and the Bushwhackers. The Bushwhackers did horrible things during the conflict and I’ve seen people online say that that provides the grayness to the portrayal of the two sides but the movie doesn’t really show it that way lol. If you only go by the movie, you wouldn’t think too badly of the Bushwhackers side at all. 

As I understand it, Clint is a libertarian so being pro-states rights and anti-big federal government does line up. Plus, when you take into account how the book was written by a KKK member, it also comes together.

Furthermore, while googling about all this stuff, I just found out that, according to Wikipedia at least, Clint Eastwood is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which is described as “an American neo-Confederate nonprofit organization of male descendants of Confederate soldiers that commemorates these ancestors, funds and dedicates monuments to them, and promotes the pseudohistorical Lost Cause ideology and corresponding white supremacy.”

So that might also explain his sympathetic portrayal of that side.

I def am one to appreciate a nuanced or grey portrayal of war times. Obv in conflicts, not all the “good guys” are morally pure and not all the “bad guys” are evil for evil’s sake. I can appreciate when good guys are shown to be less than perfect and when bad guys are bad for a reason or have nuggets of humanity in otherwise immoral crusades.

But this movie doesn’t seem to do that, as far as I can grasp. The Union guys are evil, bad, vicious, backstabbing, and violent. The Confederacy are noble rebels that are betrayed when surrendering. The Union are like vindictive rabid dogs coming for the kill while that one young confederate soldier shows his humanity by proclaiming his fear of dying.

Obv there’s way more to the film and I’m not covering all that in this post, just this topic specifically.

The characters felt so real—flawed but relatable—and the humor struck a perfect balance between dark and heartwarming. Olive’s innocence and determination completely stole my heart.

By the time the final pageant scene came around, I was laughing through tears. It was such a beautiful reminder that life doesn’t have to be perfect to be meaningful, and even in the chaos, there’s love and hope. Watching it felt like a much-needed hug.

2025-01-10 01:25:17,"Decision to Leave (2022): What am i missing? Apologies if i may sound dumb, but this is what i experienced while watching this Park Chan-wook flick as an average moviegoer. I really loved his work in Oldboy and The Handmaiden, and both of them are one of the best movies that i've watched in my lifetime.

But I'm not sure about this one, probably because i didn't get what the director was trying to convey.

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

So basically, the story is about an insomniac detective, who's married to a nuclear power plant worker, but they only get to meet once a week because both of them work in different cities. One day, he encounters a case where a chinese immigrant is suspected of killing her husband, and becomes totally obsessed with her while investigating it. He follows her, stalks her and secretly takes pictures and voice recordings of her. Meanwhile, she being a smart and self-aware woman, knows all about it. But she choses to use it for her own advantage by distracting him from the investigation.

Now here's the confusing part. Both the critics and the director himself, have described it's genre as 'romance'. In fact one critic even labelled it as the 'Most Romantic Movie of the Year'. But imho, in order for a movie to qualify as a 'romance', the protagonists must have qualities that are 'redeeming' in nature, so that we can root for them throughout the film.

By contrast, the detective here is portrayed as a stalker and a cheater, whereas the immigrant is a morally grey character, who was a domestic abuse victim, but also has an almost psychopathic demeanor.

The film also mentions a Confucius quote (which is also the theme of the film btw), which says 'The wise love water (seas), whereas the benevolent love mountains', where the mountains and seas are metaphors for 'stability' and 'instability' respectively. We later get to know that the detective prefers mountains (which represents stability, a reference to his married life with his wife), whereas the immigrant woman prefers the seas (which represents mystery and unpredictability). And during the course of the film, the detective's character arc goes on so that he eventually gets drawn towards the sea, at the end.

When asked why he chose this particular theme, the director said:

>Park says viewers should pay particular attention to how his wife uses those pockets, as opposed to how Seo-rae (the immigrant) does.

>“It’s true all the women in his life are taking things out of his pockets, but there’s an important difference between the two women taking things: His wife, despite the fact that she spent a long time with her husband, she doesn’t know what is in which pocket in his jacket. While Seo-rae knows exactly what to get from which pocket.”

>“It’s about loneliness, about trying to find someone to be with,” Park says. “It’s about trying to find someone to love, despite all the loneliness in your life.”

https://www.polygon.com/23445882/decision-to-leave-ending-explained-park-chan-wook-interview

But the director fails to convince us as to why the quest to 'find someone to love' and combating 'loneliness' would require engaging in infidelity, instead of trying to repair the already existing marriage OR getting a divorce when things fail to work out.

When asked about what the ending meant, he said:

>Park has often said what links his movies in his mind is the theme of responsibility — the way his characters do or don’t take responsibility for their own actions. In this case, Seo-rae’s way of accepting the consequences of her murders is a way of atoning that may leave viewers melancholy or angry, but Park feels it’s a significant choice for her to make either way.

However, upon a closer look, you'd realise her suicide has less to do with 'atonement', and more to do with 'teaching him a lesson'. At one point in the movie Seo-rae says 'The moment you said you loved me, your love ended. And when your love for me ended, my love for you began'. At the same time, she accurately uncovered his obsession with cold cases, and now, she leaves him with a mystery that he’ll never be able to unravel, i.e. whether she actually died or not, and what happened to her body. By choosing a form of death that will keep him endlessly guessing, she’s guaranteeing he’ll always remember and obsess over her, the way she obsessed over him. 

This makes the ending less of a 'heartbreaking tragedy' like the Oldboy, unlike what the critics were suggesting, as I was never truly able to empathize with the protagonist (the detective) in the first place.

Overall, I found Decision to leave not having enough substance to warrant it's runtime. While the cinematography, editing and direction were excellent, the screenplay wasn't engaging at all, and it's pacing was slow too. It made me want to hurry up and finish the movie.
